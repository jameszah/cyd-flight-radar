# Project notes: CYD flight radar on Freenove FNK0104B

Fork of nicholaswilde/cyd-flight-radar, ported to the owner's **Freenove FNK0104B**
(ESP32-S3, 2.8" ILI9341 240x320, FT6336 capacitive touch, native USB-C).
Built and flashed from VS Code + PlatformIO on Windows. `fnk0104b` is the default env.

## Build / flash
- `pio run -e fnk0104b` (build), `pio run -e fnk0104b -t upload`, `pio device monitor -e fnk0104b`
- Native USB: if upload can't connect, hold BOOT, tap RST, release BOOT, retry.
- `config/secrets.h` exists with blank SSID/password on purpose (gitignored): the board
  opens the `cyd-flight-radar-XXXX` captive portal for Wi-Fi and location.

## Board pins (from Freenove's FNK0104AB TFT_eSPI setup + touch sketch)
- LCD SPI: MOSI 11, SCLK 12, MISO 13, CS 10, DC 46, BL 45, RST -1. Needs colour inversion (`TFT_INVERT`).
- Touch FT6336 (I2C 0x38): SDA 16, SCL 15, RST 18, INT 17. BOOT button GPIO 0. WS2812 LED GPIO 42.

## Changes made vs upstream
- `platformio.ini`: added `[env:fnk0104b]` (esp32-s3-devkitc-1, USB CDC on boot) and made it default.
- `include/hardware/lgfx_config.hpp`: `FT6336_TOUCH` branch using `lgfx::Touch_FT5x06`;
  touch axes reversed (x_min=W-1..0, y_min=H-1..0) because the panel is mounted 180° from the LCD;
  `TFT_INVERT` option for ILI9341.
- `src/ui/radar_display.cpp`: radar sweep cut from 21 lines to 7 (`kSweepLines`, `kSweepStepDeg`);
  trail drawing uses `services::adsb::kTrailLength`.
- `include/services/adsb_client.h` / `src/services/adsb_client.cpp`: flight-path trail length is now
  `kTrailLength = 18` (was a hard-coded 6).
- `src/ui/runway_overlay.cpp`: airport ident labels placed above-right of each airport's on-screen
  runway extent (`drawLabelUpRight`), clamped inside the 240px radar square; falls back to old placement
  if no runway is visible. `include/ui/radar_theme.h`: `kRunwayLabelGapPx` 3 -> 4.
- `src/main.cpp`: re-enabled tap-to-cycle-range on the scale label (upstream commit c1436fc had
  disabled it; `radarDisplayIsScaleTapped` was still present). Label sits at the radar's 3 o'clock edge.
- `README.md`: added an FNK0104B section.
- `src/services/adsb_client.cpp` (branch `feat/route-lookup`): restored the adsbdb.com route lookup that
  upstream `aba1fc6` stubbed out. Tapping a plane queues its callsign; the next `fetchUpdate()` calls
  `fetchRoute()` first (same `s_client`, raw HTTP/1.0, stopped before the adsb.fi request), keeps one
  cached result (`s_route_result_*`), and copies it onto that aircraft. Info panel shows `| LAX -> JFK`.

## Not yet verified on hardware
- Range-label tap (just re-enabled) and the airport label placement.
- Route lookup: watch serial for `route: ... HTTP 200` / `route: X -> Y` and the `heap[...]` lines.
